                      <p class="card-text move-card">Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. In this course, I'll show you exactly how to set it up regardless of what operating system your computer is.

                        The setup process can be very simple (such as download Python and run it) but it can also start to get rather complex. My goal is to break apart this complexity and put it into manageable chunks that allow you to actually have a solid foundation of how to install Python and actually use it in real projects.
                        
                        This course is the result of nearly a decade of teaching students around the world how to best setup Python environments and develop applications and automations with Python. Based on feedback, this course will continue to be updated and upgraded to ensure you have the best possible way to set up your Python development environment at your fingertips.

                        A project like this is really a collection of 3 parts:
                        
                        Web Process: Setup up Django to collect user's interest and provide recommendations once available.
                        Machine Learning Pipeline: Extract data from Django, transform it, and train a Collaborative Filtering model.
                        Worker Process: This is the glue. We'll use Celery to schedule/run the trained model predictions and update data for Django-related user recommendations.

                      <p class="card-text move-card">Building a web application has never been easier thanks to open source. In this course, we're going to go step-by-step building a Django web application. If you've never used Django before, this is the course for you.

                        Django is one of the most popular web frameworks written in the Python programming language. Django and Python are both open source and free to use commercially. This means you don't have to pay a dime to create amazing software and impact people all around the world. Django powers many websites in the world including: Instagram, Pinterest, NASA, Baserow, this website, and so many others.
                        
                        The goal of this course to teach you the fundamentals of Django while also creating a very practical project. Building something real is important because it gives you the context of how, when, and where to use a lot of Django's great features.
                        
                        Django sits right in the middle of creating an app from scratch and using something like Wordpress. This means we have a lot of features we could implement along with a lot of features that just work by default. This makes Django incredibly flexible so that we can go far beyond what a blogging platform offers while being faster than starting from absolute 0.
                        
                        For our User Interface, we're going to learn the fundamentals of Bootstrap. Bootstrap makes our Django project look far more professional in very little time. Not only that, we'll also have a much better user experience by leveraging many of Bootstrap's built-in features.
                        
                        If we were building a house, Django would be the plumbing, the walls, and electricity while Bootstrap is the interior decorator.
                        
                        Here's a few things we'll cover:
                        
                        Django version 4.1 (or even 2.2+)
                        Python version 3.10 (or 3.8+)
                        Bootstrap 5.2+
                        Collecting data from users
                        Rendering HTML templates and documents
                        Password-protected pages & user-type permissions
                        Modeling data in Django as it relates to a spreadsheet
                        Dynamically disply content based on stored database data
                        Much more

                      <p class="card-text move-card">This series is all about sustainably deploying Django into production on virtual machines we control. Production can get rather messy so we're going to limit the amount of manual work and opt for as much automation work as possible. To do this, we're going to be focusing on these core areas:

                        CI / CD with Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions
                        Django on Docker & DockerHub (as well as using WatchTower)
                        Load Balancing with NGINX
                        Production Databases with managed MySQL by Linode
                        Local/Development use of production-like Databases
                        Terraform to provision Infrastructure on Linode
                        Ansible to configure infrastructure on Linode (in tandem with Terraform)
                        Django-based File Uploads & Django Static Files on Linode Object Storage
                        This course focuses on getting Django into production, but most of what we cover can be adapted for many other technologies as well. The reason? Our Django project will run through Docker with Docker containers. Docker is a massive key to putting many, many different applications in production. It's a great tool, and we'll use it as the backbone that Django sits on.
                        
                        Before all the branded names for the tech stack start to scare you off, I want you to remember that so much of what we'll do here is writing a bunch of documents with a specific syntax and goal. Just because it's called Docker or Python or Terraform, they are still all just documents that describe… something.
                        
                        With that in mind, I want you to think of the above list like this:
                        
                        GitHub: a place to store our code, almost like a folder on your computer.
                        GitHub Actions: an app that automatically starts a chain of events related to testing (verifying the document does what the writer intended), building (let's put a stamp on this code and say that this version is done), and running our code in production (find the code that should run the best, is ready, and let's and run that)
                        Django: A bunch of python documents to handle the logic of an HTML website, store data, and handle user data.
                        Docker: essentially a document that we write to describe, on the operating system level, how our Django app needs to run. Docker itself does more than this, but we mostly work on the document part (a Dockerfile).
                        Load Balancing with NGINX: a document that we write to tell nginx to send incoming website traffic to the different servers running our Docker-based Django app. Managed databases: a powerful spreadsheet that you never need to open or touch (thanks to Linode & Django).
                        Terraform: a document describing all of the products and services we need from Linode (like virtual machines) to run our Django project.
                        Ansible: a few documents we use to tell all of the products and services what software our Django project needs is needed to run.
                        Linode Object Storage: a file system (sort of) that allows us to store files that don't change very often like images and videos as well as other documents like CSS and some kinds of JavaScript.
                        If you read the above and thought to yourself, "well that's overly simplistic" -- you're right! If you read the above and thought to yourself, "oh no, what am I doing with my life" -- you're right!
                        
                        The nice thing about what we're doing here is taking the guesswork out of making this list work, work correctly, and work reliably. Most of the technology we will cover here has been well established and will likely remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.

                        Web APIs, also know as REST APIs, are how applications can communicate with each other. Essentially, we'll design a standard way to enable our Django project (through Django REST Framework) to communicate with nearly anything else such as:
                        
                        React.js/Vue/Angular apps
                        Phone & Table Native Apps (like iOS or Andriod)

                      <p class="card-text move-card">Learn how to deploy a production-ready Django application into a Kubernetes cluster.

                        Kubernetes is a tool to manage containers. This type of management is called orchestration because it does more than just manage the containers such as it will scale up and scale down resources as needed (among many other things).
                        
                        Since Kubernetes is a massive tool, we're going to be covering a practical implementation using a Docker-based Django application.
                        
                        Django is a way to build web applications rapidly using Python. There are many ways to get Django into production so the question is why use K8S at all? There's many reasons we'll cover throughout this series but here are a few:
                        
                        Gracefully deploy Docker-based Django projects
                        Scale up (or scale down) your web apps with ease
                        Use a few or a lot of microservices internally or externally
                        Self-heal when services go down
                        Simplify app deployment (after initial configuration)
                        Streamline your backend Infrastructure (provision virtual machines and let k8s do the rest)
                        Kubernetes can do a lot which makes it a great tool to learn but also a daunting one at that. To make it more approachable here's what we'll be doing:
                        
                        Start a Python Virtual Environment
                        Create a bare bones production-ready Django project
                        Create a Dockerfile to describe our environment (much like this blog post)
                        Use a managed Database service from DitgitalOcean
                        Install Kubernetes locally
                        Start a Kubernetes Cluster on DigitalOcean
                        Provision a Deployment and Service for our Django project
                        Implement Github Action Workflows to automate future deployments

                        Bolt is an open source tool that helps automate the configuration of your infrastructure. Since Bolt is agentless, it's a modern approach to handling the orchestration of the various software and services your projects need.
                        
                        The goal of this series is to do something practical so you can reuse Puppet Bolt in your projects and modify what we do to suit your project's needs.
